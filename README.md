## Struggle

- **24/12/2023** : After 4 days of struggle I am getting the grips of the things I did once.
  - After setting up things by re reading things from odin project I struggled with the issue that when I create a Navlink for a element but don't setup route for it in browser router why was I not getting 404 error. I clicked the links with no route setup only got the warning in console that no routes matched.
  - This bugged me a lot tried the react router official tutorial and had the 404 error. After banging my head on the friday and saturday, set the things from scratch and created nav links did the same things again. Then got the idea that I will not get error if I create a navlink for a element and not setup it's route I will not get the error if I click the link. But I will get the 404 error and warning of the no routes matched in the console when I will enter the path whose route is not setup. I don't know why I don't get error when I click the navlink. But getting the 404 error page was good.
  - I was sturggling with how to have my nav bar render with every page. Did some funcky things but had the gut feeling that it was not right. So followed [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5s57C7leXc4) on youtube and it really did help in understanding of what is what and I followed the same steps like this. I also followed it since it was similar to the odin project tut.
  - Things are kind of on right track since now I get into writing things that I really want write instead of getting bugged by certain things.
